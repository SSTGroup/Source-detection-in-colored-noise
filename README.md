# Source detection in colored noise


Most approaches in array signal processing assume the signals to be embedded in white noise. However, this assumption is unrealistic in many scenarios, such as statistical shape models. 
We propose a strategy that can handle colored noise in the detection of the number of sources. 
We model the source detection as a regression problem and apply information-theoretic criteria to determine the model order of the regression. 

The technique is available in MATLAB code in the function sd_colorednoise.m
